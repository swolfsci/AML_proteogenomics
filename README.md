# AML_proteogenomics

This public repository includes selections of quarto documents for public showcast. While the majority of the analytical work is deposited in the private Oellerich Lab repository, there exist several workflows that I want to share publicly. This includes for example

-   Cleanup, pre-processing and harmonization of LFQ data sets here

-   Pre-processing, scale-factor based normalization and transformation of whole transcriptome bulk RNA sequencing here

I will extend this repository with new analyses for public sharing.
